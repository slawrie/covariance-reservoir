## covariance-reservoir
----------------------
This repository contains basic scripts to generate and train models and synthetic data samples as analyzed in "Covariance-based information processing in reservoir computing systems", by S. Lawrie, R. Moreno-Bote and M. Gilson (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.30.441789).

## Dependencies
The `conda`environment specifications used for this project can be found in `environment.yml`. However, not all dependencies listed there are strictly necesary.
Main required Python libraries have widespread use (matplotlib, scikit-learn, scipy, numpy, pandas, os), so the scripts can be ran on any environment provided those libraries are installed.

## Synthetic data
File `synthetic_data.py` contains all code relevant to produce synthetic datasets as analyzed in the paper. The instantiations we specifically analyzed will also be freely available in Zenodo, after article publication.

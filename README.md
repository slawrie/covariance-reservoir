# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## covariance-reservoir
----------------------
This repository contains basic scripts to generate and train models and synthetic data samples as analyzed in "Covariance-based information processing in reservoir computing systems", by S. Lawrie, R. Moreno-Bote and M. Gilson (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.30.441789).

## Dependencies
The `conda`environment specifications used for this project can be found in `environment.yml`. However, not all dependencies listed there are strictly necesary.
Main required Python libraries have widespread use (matplotlib, scikit-learn, scipy, numpy), so the scripts can be ran on any environment provided those libraries are installed.
